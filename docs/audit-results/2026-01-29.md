## Critical Findings

None.

---

## High Priority Findings

### [HIGH] F8 - Column headers not preserved from PDF

**Source:** Project-specific audit (scripts/audit.py)
**Status:** BLOCKER
**Brief:** 005
**Issue:** CSV headers are invented snake_case (`permeability_air_md`) instead of original PDF headers (`Permeability (md) Air`).

### [HIGH] F9 - Header variations not handled

**Source:** Project-specific audit (scripts/audit.py)
**Status:** BLOCKER
**Brief:** 004
**Issue:** Multi-row headers spanning columns not properly merged. Continuation pages not detected.

---

## Medium Priority Findings

### [MEDIUM] 0802 - Missing reports for Issue #1

**Issue:** Closed issue "test(unit): Add unit tests for core analysis pipeline" has no corresponding reports in `docs/reports/`.
**Recommendation:** Create implementation and test reports, or document that reports are not required for test-only issues.

### [MEDIUM] 0804 - File inventory references old project name

**Issue:** `docs/00003-file-inventory.md` header says "demo-004-invoice" instead of "RCA-PDF-extraction-pipeline".
**Recommendation:** Update inventory header and verify directory structure matches.

### [MEDIUM] 0817 - README paths may be outdated

**Issue:** README references `data/output/core_analysis_minimal.csv` but files were moved to `data/output/spec/`.
**Recommendation:** Update README to reflect new output structure.

### [MEDIUM] Q1 - Code modularity

**Source:** Project-specific audit
**Status:** WARN
**Brief:** 010
**Issue:** `core_analysis_minimal.py` has only 1 function. Target: 7-8 discrete functions.

---

## Low Priority Findings

### [LOW] 0814 - AGPL license note

**Issue:** PyMuPDF uses AGPL license which has copyleft implications.
**Status:** Documented in README - acceptable for assignment submission.
**Recommendation:** For commercial use, evaluate license implications or switch to MIT-licensed alternative.

## Info

### [INFO] Project-specific audit system exists

The project has its own audit system at `scripts/audit.py` with 19 checks covering:
- Functional requirements (F1-F9)
- Quality requirements (Q1-Q6)
- Deliverable requirements (D1-D4)

Results: 15 PASS, 1 WARN, 2 BLOCKER, 1 SKIP

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Submission)

1. [ ] Fix F8: Preserve original column headers (brief 005)
2. [ ] Fix F9: Handle header variations across pages (brief 004)
3. [ ] Update README with correct output paths

### Short-term

4. [ ] Refactor code for modularity (brief 010)
5. [ ] Update file inventory with correct project name
6. [ ] Create reports for Issue #1 (or document exemption)

### Deferred (Enhancement)

7. [ ] Implement footnote symbol handling (brief 006)
8. [ ] Create analytics-ready output format (brief 007)
9. [ ] Add data validation script (brief 008)
10. [ ] Implement spec vs extended comparison (brief 009)
