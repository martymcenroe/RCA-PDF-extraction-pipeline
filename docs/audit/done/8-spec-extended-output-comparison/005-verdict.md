# Issue Review: Orchestrator Clarification Request

## Identity Confirmation
I am Gemini 3 Pro, acting as Senior Technical Product Manager & Governance Lead.

## Pre-Flight Gate: FAILED

The submitted text does not meet the structural requirements for a GitHub Issue review. The content provided appears to be a request for architectural clarification (a discussion item) rather than a defined work item (Feature, Bug, or Spike) intended for the backlog.

### Missing Required Sections:
- [ ] User Story
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Definition of Done

**Verdict: REJECTED - Please format this as a formal Issue (likely a "Spike" given the need for investigation/decision) including a User Story ("As a developer, I need to determine..."), clear Acceptance Criteria (Specific questions answered), and Definition of Done.**
