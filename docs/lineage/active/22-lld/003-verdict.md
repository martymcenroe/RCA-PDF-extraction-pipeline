# LLD Review: [Missing ID]-[Missing Title]

## Identity Confirmation
I am Gemini 3 Pro, acting as Senior Software Architect & AI Governance Lead.

## Pre-Flight Gate: FAILED

The submitted LLD does not meet structural requirements for review. The document provided appears to be a fragment starting from Section 6.2, lacking critical introductory sections.

### Missing Required Elements:
- [ ] **GitHub Issue Link** - No issue reference found (e.g., "Implements #47") in the document header.
- [ ] **Context/Scope Section** - No "Context" or "Scope" section (Section 1) defining the problem or business value.
- [ ] **Proposed Changes Section** - No high-level "Proposed Changes" or "Files Changed" section (Sections 2/3) preceding the detailed design.

**Verdict: REJECTED - LLD must include all required elements before review can proceed.**
