ORCHESTRATOR CLARIFICATION NEEDED:

1. **License Compatibility Question:** Gemini requests confirmation of G-FIAT's license before proceeding. The feedback states PyMuPDF (AGPL v3.0) may be incompatible depending on the project license. I need to know:
   - What is the G-FIAT repository license?
   - Should I switch the Technical Approach to use `pypdf` or `pdfminer.six` instead of PyMuPDF, or is AGPL acceptable?

2. **Inline Images Scope Question:** Gemini asks whether "inline images" should truly be out of scope for MVP since forensic artifacts may hide there. Should inline image extraction be added to MVP scope?

Please advise on both points so I can complete the revision with all feedback addressed.
